# Introduction

This repository contains excerices I did to get better grasp how Rust works. Some of these excercises are from "The Rust Programming Language" book.

I have named my own excercises little bit differently so those would be easier to spot. The naming scheme used is `x.x.5` whenever I have done excercise that doesn't come from the book.
