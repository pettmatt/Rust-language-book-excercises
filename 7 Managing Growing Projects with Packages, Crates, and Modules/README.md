# My thoughts so far

It seems like this is the point where the "real" development environment study starts. Managing projects with packages, crates and modules... can't wait to see what kind of tips and tricks this chapter holds. To be honest I'm not a fan of reading the basics of language, but it's important part of learning a new programming language.

**A package can contain multiple binary crates and optionally one library crate. As a package grows, you can extract parts into separate crates that become external dependencies.**

That sounds interesting. Can't wait to learn more about it. I'm so **excited**!

**We’ll also discuss encapsulating implementation details, which lets you reuse code at a higher level: once you’ve implemented an operation, other code can call your code via its public interface without having to know how the implementation works. The way you write code defines which parts are public for other code to use and which parts are private implementation details that you reserve the right to change. This is another way to limit the amount of detail you have to keep in your head.**

I think this isn't really that complicated, but the way it's written it sounds harder to grasp than what it probably is.
