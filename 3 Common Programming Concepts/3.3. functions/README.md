Note 1: Statements cannot return values. If statements could it would be called a bug or an expression. Expressions can return values and it's usually expected of them to do so. Statements are also the things that contain expressions and wiseversa, expressions are the things that give statements their values. It's a good thing to understand what these terms mean, in case of an error that points out that "this thing you're trying to do isn't really possible with statements".
